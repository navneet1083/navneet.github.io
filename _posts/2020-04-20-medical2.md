# Medical Diagnosis

- *Dermatalogy* - Deals with skin diseases
- *Opthalmology* - Deals with diagnoses and treatment of eye disorders.
- *Histopathology* - Medical speciality involving examining of tissue under the microscope. [study involves is to check the cancer spread]



## Evaluations

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - How good is a model :
   $$ Accuracy = \dfrac{Examples\ correctly \ classified} {Total\ number\ of\ examples} $$
  - Accuracy in terms of conditional probability
    - could be defined as :
    $$ Accuracy = P(correct) $$
    - Well, the above is not always correct; because it could be biased if multiple labels are there, so it can be modified as :
    $$ Accuracy = P(correct\ \cap \ disease) + P(correct\  \cap \ normal) $$
    - Law of conditional probability
    $$ P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) $$
    So, the above accuracy can be defined as :
    $$ Accuracy = P(correct|disease)P(disease) + P(correct|normal)P(normal) $$
    $$ Accuracy = P(+|disease)P(disease) + P(-|normal)P(normal) $$
    - Sensitivity - `true positive rate`
    - Specificity - `true negative rate`
    - *Sensitivity* - It is the probability that the model classify the patient is having a disease given that they have the disease.
    - *Specificity* - It is the probability that the model classify the patient as being normal given that they are normal
    - So the accuracy would be defined as :
    $$ Accuracy = Sensitivity\ * \ P(disease) + Specificity \ * \ P(normal) $$
    $$ Accuracy = Sensitivity * prevalence + Specificity * (1 - prevalence) $$
    - Sensitivity and Specificity can be computed as :
    $$ P(+|disease) = sensitivity = \dfrac{\#(+\ and\ disease)}{\#(disease)} $$
    $$ P(-|normal) = specificity = \dfrac{\#(-\ and\ normal)}{\#(normal)} $$
    - Prevalence can be computed as :
    $$ prevalence = P(disease) = \dfrac{\#(disease)} {\#(total)}$$
    - PPV (Positive Predictive Value) - If a model prediction is positive, what is the probability that a patient has a disease:
    $$ P(disease\ |\ +) $$
    - NPV (Negative Predictive Vlaue) - If a model prediction is negative, what is the probability that a patient is normal:
    $$ P(normal\ |\ -) $$
    - PPV & NPV
    $$PPV = P(disease|+) = \dfrac{\#(+\ and\ disease)}{\#(+)} $$
    $$NPV = P(normal|-) = \dfrac{\#(-\ and\ normal)}{\#(-)} $$
    - Confusion Matrix:
    
    |             |     +         |    -           |
    | ----------- | ------------- |--------------- |
    | Disease     | True Positive | False Negative |
    | Normal      | False Positive| True Negative  |
    
    $$ Sensitivity = \dfrac{TP}{TP\ + \ FN}$$
    $$ Specificity = \dfrac{FP}{FP\ +\ TN}$$
    $$ PPV = \dfrac{TP}{TP\ + \ FP} $$
    $$ NPV = \dfrac{FN}{FN\ + \ TN} $$
    
    - Another way of computing PPV:
    $$ PPV = \dfrac{sensitivity * prevalence}{(sensitivity * prevalence)+((1-specificity)*(1-prevalence))} $$
    
## Segmentation

- Image Segmentation
  - Soft Dice Loss of image segmentation problem
  $$L(P,G) = 1 - \dfrac{2\sum_i^n p_ig_i}{\sum_i^n p_i^2 + \sum_i^n g_i^2} $$
  - `P` is predicted value & `G` is ground truth value
